# gmapIcons2osmand

Convertion of KMZ file to gpx file for osmand but with icons (from newer google icons style to osmand icons).

Generally osmand can import KMZ file but every icon is converted to red star.
Osmand can't import gmail icons. It is not possible.

The converter will try to find the best icon stored in osmand that is the most similar to gmap icon.

Proposition of mapping between gmap and osmand icons can be find in icons-gmap-osmand.pdf

Project is based on https://www.mail-archive.com/osmand@googlegroups.com/msg07817.html

PS</br>
Python 3 is needed.</br>
There are some icons for my needs only implemented for this moment.</br>
Not implemented icons are presented as black icon in osmand to easier find what to do.</br>
Let me know if you have suggestions and don't know how to do it.</br>

If you like it you can buy me a cup of coffee or glass of beer :)</br>
